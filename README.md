# Cplusplus-Program

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I made this app for an academic project. The scenario involves a banking company and their goal to help students learn about handling money. Its purpose is to illustrate the principles of investments and the impact of compound interest through an interactive system.

#What did you do particularly well?
I took a modular approach to this project. I utilized functions to break the code into smaller pieces, making it more readable and manageable. I also organized the code into a class with the idea of encapsulation in mind. I validated user input very well making sure to take care of non-numeric inputs. Besides all of the functional points that make this project exceptional, I believe I made the layout for the user reports easy to read with a user-friendly design.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Looking at my code, I can see unnecessary repetition. I think there could have been another way to validate user input without rewriting the code several times. If I had done that, it would reduce code redundancy, making it "better" and more efficient code.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The validation of user input and ensuring that the code is readable while maintaining functionality was my greatest challenge in this project. I referred back to my academic references to relearn certain strategies to overcome this issue, such as "while (!(cin >> annualInterest)) {}" This was a lifesaver for me when it came to user validation.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
I think the most important skill I learned from this project was the use of a class or Object-Oriented Programming. I know this is a transferrable skill because there are several OOP languages it can be applied to. Besides this one skill, I have also gotten more practice with error handling, debugging, formatting, and utilization of libraries. Which are all important skills to learn as a developer. 

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable because it's modular. Having the code broken into pieces promotes those characteristics. I also use comments to describe the written code, in the case of collaboration, it will be readable and adaptable.
