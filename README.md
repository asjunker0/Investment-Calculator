# Programming Languages Project Overview
__Project Summary and Solution__<br/>
The scenario in this academic projects involves a banking company and their goal to help students learn about handling money. Its purpose is to illustrate the principles of investments and the impact of compound interest through an interactive system.

__What went well?__<br/>
I took a modular approach to this project. I utilized functions to break the code into smaller pieces, making it more readable and manageable. I also organized the code into a class with the idea of encapsulation in mind. I validated user input very well making sure to take care of non-numeric inputs. Besides all of the functional points that make this project exceptional, I believe I made the layout for the user reports easy to read with a user-friendly design.

__Areas for Code Enhancement__<br/>
Looking at my code, I can see unnecessary repetition. I think there could have been another way to validate user input without rewriting the code several times. If I had done that, it would reduce code redundancy, making it "better" and more efficient code.

__Challenges & Solutions__<br/>
The validation of user input and ensuring that the code is readable while maintaining functionality was my greatest challenge in this project. I referred back to my academic references to relearn certain strategies to overcome this issue, such as "while (!(cin >> annualInterest)) {}" This was a lifesaver for me when it came to user validation.

__Transferable Skills__<br/>
I think the most important skill I learned from this project was the use of a class or Object-Oriented Programming. I know this is a transferrable skill because there are several OOP languages it can be applied to. Besides this one skill, I have also gotten more practice with error handling, debugging, formatting, and utilization of libraries. Which are all important skills to learn as a developer. 

__Maintaining Code Quality__<br/>
This program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable because it's modular. Having the code broken into pieces promotes those characteristics. I also use comments to describe the written code, in the case of collaboration, it will be readable and adaptable.
